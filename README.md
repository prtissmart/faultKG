This is a program for creating a faulted knowledge graph and sorting it in time.
This program extracts the fault data from the shpfile and creates a directed graph based on the fault cuts.
The file structure includes the test data folder, the fault class faultKG.py, and the main test program.
program function：
1.Generate a fault directed graph.
2.Determine the generation order based on the fault cutting relationship and sort by generation time.
3.Output rdf files are generally opened in different knowledge graph databases.
How to start：
1.You can open test_main.py or Create a new file for testing.
2.The data folder contains two test data.You can use both or use your own fault data.
3.File paths for inputting fault data and outputting rdf files.
